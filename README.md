### Overview
_The aim of this project is to combine my current knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript with what I've been able to learn from the back end development process of making an application. Main purpose of this project is to utilize Python programming language integrated with MongoDB and Flask framework, to create a database for storing and retrieving data efficiently. As such I have decided to create the following skincare review site, which allow users to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) reviews/data.
'Skincare confessions' is an open source application for all to use but would consider skincare and beauty enthusiasts the main target audience. Passionate to discover and explore new brands, share or perhaps keep track and store own favorite brands._
