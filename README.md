### Overview
_The aim of this project is to combine my current knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript with what I've been able to learn from the back end development process of making an application. Main purpose of this project is to utilize Python programming language integrated with MongoDB and Flask framework, to create a database for storing and retrieving data efficiently. As such I have decided to create the following skincare review site, which allow users to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) reviews/data.
'Skincare confessions' is an open source application for all to use but would consider skincare and beauty enthusiasts the main target audience. Passionate to discover and explore new brands, share or perhaps keep track and store own favorite brands._

A combination of modern and minimalist design approach with simple intuitive structure, making it easy for users to quickly adapt and allure them to keep coming back. The website application will be built with a mobile first approach because of its simplicity and light content also taking into consideration that the majority of our audience most likely will be browsing online using a smartphone device because of 21st century convince.
  'Skincare confessions' enables access to all the reviews that's been published on the site even for non-registered users. With an additional function to subscribe to a newsletter keeping the user updated and engaged in whatâ€™s happening in the skincare community.
